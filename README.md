### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Dataset

### Description
This project is Project 2 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It uses codes to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It also writes a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Software used
Python 3, NumPy, and pandas

### Questions explored
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:
* What is the most popular month for start time?
* What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
* What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
* What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
* What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
* What is the most popular trip?
* What are the counts of each user type?
* What are the counts of gender?
* What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
* Display the raw data for user
